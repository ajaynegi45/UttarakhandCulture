# Contributing to Himalayan Echoes

So, you want to contribute? Awesome. We're happy to have you.

This project thrives on community input. Whether you're fixing a bug, improving the UI, or adding new data about a local festival, your help makes a difference.

## How to Contribute

The process is straightforward. We use the standard GitHub flow.

### 1. Fork and Clone
First, fork the repo to your own GitHub account. Then clone it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/himalayan-echoes.git
cd himalayan-echoes
```

### 2. Create a Branch
Don't work on `main`. Create a new branch for your feature or fix. Give it a meaningful name so we know what it's about.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/better-navbar-mobile
# or
git checkout -b fix/typo-in-festivals
```

### 3. Make Your Changes
Write your code. If you're adding data, make sure it's accurate. If you're changing the UI, try to keep it responsive and clean.

### 4. Test It
Run the dev server and make sure everything looks good.

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. Commit and Push
Keep your commit messages clear.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: improve mobile navbar layout"
git push origin feature/better-navbar-mobile
```

### 6. Open a Pull Request
Go to the original repository on GitHub and open a Pull Request (PR) from your branch.
*   **Title**: Clear summary of what you did.
*   **Description**: Explain *why* you made the change and *how* to test it.

## What We Look For
*   **Clean Code**: Readable, well-structured types and components.
*   **Accuracy**: Since this is a cultural project, correctness of data (history, geography) is crucial.
*   **Respect**: Be kind in your code reviews and comments.
